# Drone_Position_Control

This repository contains an altered version of the ArduPilot firmware with a custom data-driven time delay controller integrated into the attitude control loop.

The controller was developed as part of a project in the Automation & Control program at RPTU (Rheinland-Pfälzische Technische Universität) and has been tested on a custom-built hexacopter platform.

## Features

- Modified ArduPilot firmware core
- Data-driven time delay controller for improved attitude loop performance
- Tested on custom hexacopter hardware

## Usage

This repository serves as the firmware base for research and experimentation related to advanced control strategies for multirotor UAVs.
